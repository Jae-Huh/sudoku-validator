**SUDOKU VALIDATOR**

***A tool for validating whether a 9 X 9 Sudoku board is valid.***

I was given this task in a programming interview and I totally botched it. I made this project to prove to myself that I could 
do it.

**FUNCTIONALITY**

Given any 9 X 9 matrix as an input, the program will return whether this matrix qualifies as a valid sudoku board. Sudoku is a famous number placement puzzle. The objective of the game is to fill the 9 X 9 grid such that each column, each row, and each 3 X 3 subgrid is composed of numbers ranging from 1 to 9.
